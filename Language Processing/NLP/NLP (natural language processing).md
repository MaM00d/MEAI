## Tasks
1. Read the already made projects
2. take parts of the open sourced ones that we can use in our projects
3. finalize the steps fill the steps with what NLP is needed to work
4. try to get get feelings from the text try to make the main idea
5. keep modifying the language model and cleaning it and add more data 
6. keep searching for more psychiatric data to add to the language model to make it work as psychiatric
7. figure out a way to make it work on the android/apple/flutter/web app
8. finding the algorithm to combine many models into one
9. create a diagram to describe each part of the ML model
10. design and develop the web/mobile app
11. configure the server
12. configure a voice feature
