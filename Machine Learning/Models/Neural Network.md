Artificial neural networks are a branch of [[Machine Learning Models]]

## Neurons
- summation of all the inputs each input * the weight + the bias 
## Layers
	- Layers are just neurons next to each other 
	- All neurons in the same layer takes the same input 
- input layer - the layer in which the input is separated an
- output layer - the layer in which the output is collected 
- hidden layers - layers between them to learn the input by calculations
- embedding layers - layer that map the big numbers of the word to smaller numbers to make it ez to calculate and to faster
