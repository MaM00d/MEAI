Supervised Fine Tuning allows a model to adapt to specific tasks or datasets and improving its performance on those tasks by changing model parameters ..

The model's parameters are adjusted to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values in the smaller dataset

Supervised approach:
1- choosing the fine tuning task --> text generation, classification..
2- preparing the datasets --> "which expected to be some questions and answers related to our topic...
"prompt":------------
"completion": ---------------   " 
3- choose the base model --> "arabert"
4- fine tune the model using the supervised approach -->"[[parameters training methods]]"  
5- evaluate the performance
